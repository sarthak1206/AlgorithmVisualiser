<h3>Quick Sort</h3>
<hr>

<p>Quicksort is a sorting algorithm developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961. </p>
<p>Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on dividing an array of data into smaller arrays.</p>
<p>A large array is split into two arrays, one containing values less than a specified value, say the pivot on which the partition is created, and the other containing values greater than the pivot value.</p>
<p>The Quicksort function splits the array and is then called twice recursively to sort the two resulting subarrays.</p>
<p>This algorithm is quite efficient for large data sets. </p>
<p>Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer approach.</p>

<p>An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (an element selected from the array).</p>
<p>When dividing the array, the pivot should be placed in the middle so that the elements smaller than pivot elements are on the left side and the elements larger than pivot elements are on the right side of the pivot.</p>
<p>The left and right subfields are also split using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains one element.</p>
<p>At this point, the elements are already sorted. Finally, the elements are combined to form a sorted array.</p>
