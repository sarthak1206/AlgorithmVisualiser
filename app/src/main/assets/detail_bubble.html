<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
<hr>

<p>Bubble Sort was initially referred to as "<strong style="color: #194866;">Exchange Sort</strong>" and is now referred to as "<strong style="color: #194866;">Sinking Sort</strong>".</p>
<p>The term "Bubble Sort" was first used by Iverson in 1962.</p>
<p>Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by comparing an element to its neighboring element. After the comparison, the elements are swapped if they are not in chronological order.</p>

<p>Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm where the comparison of adjacent elements is primitive act.</p>
<p>On each pass, it compares adjacent elements in the array and swaps those that are not in sorted manner.</p>
<p>Basically, each pass through the array places the next largest value in its proper place, i.e. the comparison count is decremented by one on each pass.</p>
<p>In other words, each item "bubbles" into place where it should be in sorted order.</p>
<p>This invariant is maintained by the algorithm in each pass and therefore bubble sort correctly outputs the sorted sequence.</p>
