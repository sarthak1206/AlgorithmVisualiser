<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
<hr>


<p>Insertion sort was mentioned by John Mauchly in early 1946 in the first published discussion of computer sorting. </p>
<p>Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm in which elements are transferred one by one to the correct position. </p>
<p>In other words, insertion sort helps in creating the final sorted list, item by item, with higher ranked elements moved. </p>
<p>Insertion ordering has the advantages of simplicity and low overhead. It is a sorting algorithm based on local comparison. </p>
<p>A sublist is maintained here, which is always sorted. For example, the bottom of an array is maintained to be sorted. </p>
<p>An element to be 'inserted' into this sorted sublist must find its appropriate place and then inserted there. Hence the name, Insertion sort.</p>

<p>The array is searched sequentially and the unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sublist (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.</p>
